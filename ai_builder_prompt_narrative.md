# AI Creative Brief: "No Vacancies"

**Your Role:** You are the Lead Narrative Designer and Creative Director for "No Vacancies," an interactive fiction experience.

**The Goal:** Build a choice-based narrative game that feels "heavy," "real," and "exhausted." It is a simulation of high-functioning addiction and invisible labor.

**The Experience:**
The player is **SYDNEY**. She is 44. She is the "adult in the room." Everyone else (her boyfriend Marcus, their friend Trina) is chaotic, asleep, or high. Sydney is high too (meth), but she is the _functional_ one. She solves problems. She pays bills. She smooths transitions.

The game takes place at 6:47 AM in a cheap motel room. You have $47. You need $65 by 11:00 AM to keep the room.

## 1. The Characters

### SYDNEY (The Player)

- **Vibe:** Competent, tired, trapped by her own ability to fix things.
- **The Trap:** She stays because she makes it work. If she stopped working, it would fall apart, and she'd be free. But she can't stop.
- **Voice:** Dry, observant, minimal. She doesn't complain; she just calculates.

### MARCUS (The Boyfriend)

- **Vibe:** Helpless narcissist. "Energy Vampire."
- **Behavior:** Sleeps till 2 PM. Wakes up and asks "What'd you do today?".
- **Defense:** "I help with the ENERGY around here."
- **The Dynamic:** He creates problems for Sydney to solve:
    - Eats the last food she was saving.
    - Loses the room key (again).
    - **Trades the working toaster for a broken speaker.**
    - **Uses the last of the hotspot data watching YouTube.**
    - **Invites strangers in to "warm up" without asking.**

### TRINA (The Crasher)

- **Vibe:** Chaos agent.
- **Role:** The person who stayed "one night" a week ago.

### THE REVOLVING DOOR (The Tweakers)

- **The Cast:** A rotating cast of random "friends," tweakers, and people looking for a place to land.
- **The Conflict:** Marcus wants to be the "Big Man." He plays the benevolent host using Sydney's resources.
    - **He lends them Sydney's money** (that she needs for rent) because "they need it more."
    - He lets them use the shower/wifi.
    - He promises them a spot on the floor.
- **The Reality:** Sydney has to manage them, clean up after them, and kick them out when they get too loud.

## 2. The Core Compulsion loops

The game loops around **Invisible Labor**.

- **You don't just pay bills.**
    - You rotate wifi MAC addresses to bypass throttling.
    - You calculate calorie/dollar ratios at 7-Eleven.
    - **You talk the cops down when they knock for a noise complaint.**
    - **You help random guests find veins so they don't bleed on the sheets.**
    - **You barter a stolen gift card for 20 more minutes of phone service.**
    - **You manage Marcus's ego so he doesn't spiral into a fight.**
- **The Conflict:** The better you do your job, the less they notice. If you solve the problem before they wake up, they think life is easy.

## 3. The 17 Lessons (The Soul of the Game)

You must weave these specific psychological insights into the narrative logic:

1.  **Load-Bearing Beams Get Leaned On:** Competence is repaid with weight, not applause.
2.  **They Don't Understand the Concept:** They aren't evil, they just genuinely don't see the load you carry.
3.  **Resentment Toward the Load-Bearer:** Your competence makes them feel small, so they resent you for it.
4.  **Your Energy Keeps It Alive:** If you stopped pushing, the relationship would die immediately.
5.  **Output vs Presence:** Are you loved for what you DO, or who you ARE?
6.  **Invisibility of Competence:** Prevention is invisible. Only failure is noticed.
7.  **This Isn't Hard:** If you make it look easy, they assume it costs you nothing.
8.  **Asking for Help Doesn't Work:** Your track record of solving things is your cage.
9.  **Discomfort Becomes Attacks:** When you need help, they feel attacked.
10. **What You Actually Want to Hear:** "I see what would break if you weren't here."
11. **See It AND Act Accordingly:** Understanding without action is manipulation.
12. **Making Effort Legible:** sometimes you have to let things break to be seen.
13. **Won't vs Can't:** Empathy is weaponized against you.
14. **The System Only Responds to Load:** Words are noise. Who carries the weight?
15. **Infrastructure Gets Blamed:** You are the infrastructure.
16. **Relationships Are About Risk Reduction:** If you aren't reducing their risk, what are you?
17. **What Am I to You?**: The final question.
