# AGENTS.md (images/)

Scope: `images/` assets and prompt-to-asset mapping decisions.

## Character/Content Guardrails

- Never depict Oswaldo's face or bare skin.
- Keep Sydney continuity: 44, brunette, asymmetric bob, blue eyes, pretty.
- Work/setup visuals should depict 3-5 smartphones with pop sockets.
- Do not introduce laptops in new/updated Sydney work images.

## Style Rules

- Match existing cinematic realism and motel-grit tone.
- Avoid abrupt style drift unless explicitly requested.

## Asset Management Rules

- Use stable, descriptive snake_case filenames.
- When adding/replacing mapped assets, ensure key alignment with app image-key usage.
- Keep prompt/reference details in `ART_PROMPTS_AND_REFERENCES.md`.

## Quality Rules

- Prefer continuity and narrative fit over novelty.
- Record missing recommended assets as TODO entries, not silent omissions.
