Oswaldo is a shape under the comforter, dead to the world and to the eighteen-dollar gap between you and another day in this room.\n\nTrina is on the floor again, wrapper confetti from last night's snack cake marathon circling her like evidence. She'll wake up in an hour, eat something, drop the wrapper, and call that surviving.\n\nYour phones are lined up on the nightstand. Five screens, five chances. The ice machine hums through the wall like it's the only other thing awake in this building.\n\nYou do the math one more time. Eighteen short. Four hours.

Not checking if rent is covered. Not registering the five phones laid out like a command center on the nightstand.\n\nThe room smells like cold coffee and Trina's menthol smoke.

You don't owe coordinates to someone who couldn't find the rent money with both hands and a map.\n\nTrina stirs on the floor, senses the weather change. \"What's happening?\"\n\nWhat's happening is the load-bearing beam is removing itself from the building. What's happening is the engine is leaving and the machine doesn't know it can't run without fuel yet. What's happening is you're choosing uncertainty over the certainty of being used.\n\nThe door handle is cold. The parking lot is empty except for dawn light hitting the motel sign. No Vacancies, it says. No vacancies.\n\nYou don't know where you're going. You know what you're leaving. For the first time, that's enough.",
