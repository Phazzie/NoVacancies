You've been awake since five, running the numbers, checking the phones, calculating the distance between forty-seven dollars and sixty-five dollars like it's a math problem that might solve itself if you just look at it from the right angle. It won't. It never does. The gap is eighteen dollars and the clock doesn't care about your angle. Oswaldo is still sleeping. Of course he is. He went to bed at four after spending three hours fixing a stranger's speaker wire, a task he volunteered for with the enthusiasm he never shows when you ask him to walk to the vending machine. Trina is on the floor surrounded by snack cake wrappers like she's nesting in processed sugar. She'll wake up in an hour, eat something else, and drop another wrapper. The room smells like cold coffee, menthol smoke, and the specific staleness of a space that three people share but only one person cleans. Your phones are on the nightstand. Five screens, five pop sockets, five chances to close an eighteen-dollar gap before eleven AM. You pick up the first one and start scrolling. There's a refund pending on one account, a dispute on another, a phishing thread that might pay if the mark responds before nine. The math is always running in your head. Calories per dollar at 7-Eleven. Gigabytes left on the hotspot before it throttles. Days until the insurance premium on a car you no longer have. Hours until Oswaldo wakes up and asks what's for breakfast. The ice machine cycles through the wall. The parking lot is still dark. You're the only thing moving in this building that isn't mechanical. That's not a metaphor. That's just Tuesday. The question isn't whether you can close the gap. You always close the gap. The question is what it costs you this time, and whether anyone in this room will notice the invoice. They won't. They never do. But the room will be paid and the phones will be charged and the food will be calculated and life will go on because you made it go on, because that's what load-bearing beams do.",

She wakes up every hour to eat something and leaves the evidence behind like a crime scene. Your phones are lined up on the nightstand. Five screens. Five pop sockets. Five chances to turn eighteen dollars from a problem into a fact of life that nobody else in this room will remember by noon. The ice machine hums through the thin wall. The parking lot is still mostly dark. You pick up the first phone and check the pending refund. Twelve dollars, maybe, if the dispute clears before ten. Not enough. Never enough on the first try. But you stack small numbers into bigger ones because that is the job nobody gave you and nobody will thank you for. The room needs you to be awake right now. The room needs you to be solving this right now. The room does not know that, and if it did, it would not say so. You start working. Nobody is watching. Nobody needs to be.
