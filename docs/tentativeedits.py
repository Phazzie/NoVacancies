Based on the code, here is the comprehensive list of every "Translation Layer" text string. These are the specific lines the app feeds the AI to force it to write with "grit" instead of generic robotic politeness.

I have organized them by Category (e.g., Exhaustion, Conflict, Awareness) so you can see exactly how the game translates numbers into narrative.

1. Exhaustion Levels (Translating exhaustionLevel 0-5)
Instead of telling the AI "Sydney is tired," it sends one of these prompts:

Level 0: "She's awake, alert, and has not spent herself yet."

Level 1: "She is steady enough to run the board, but only because she's forcing it."

Level 2: "Her fuse is shorter and her patience now costs interest."

Level 3: "Small disrespect lands big. She can still perform, but the seams are visible."

Level 4: "Sydney is running on fumes. Every interaction costs more than it should."

Level 5: "Her body clocks out before her responsibilities do. Survival mode takes over the room."

2. Oswaldo's Conflict Meter (Translating oswaldoConflict -2 to 2)
This dictates how Oswaldo speaks to Sydney.

Helpful (-2): "He's weirdly helpful today, like he wants credit for doing the bare minimum without being asked."

Mild (-1): "He's not fighting, but every answer has an attitude tucked inside it."

Neutral (0): "Oswaldo hasn't been challenged. The resentment is still underground."

Defensive (1): "Every question turns into a dodge. He acts accused before anyone accuses him."

Hostile (2): "Things with Oswaldo are actively hostile. He's in full deflection mode."

3. Oswaldo's Awareness (Translating "Does he get it?")
This tracks if Oswaldo understands that Sydney is carrying him.

Blind (0): "He treats rent money like weather. It happens around him, not because of him."

Glimpse (1): "He gets flashes that she's carrying this place, then slides back into convenience."

Seeing (2): "He can name what she does now, but still acts like naming it is the same as helping."

Understands (3): "He finally sees her labor as labor, not mood, and changes behavior without being managed."

4. Sydney's Realization (Translating "Is she ready to leave?")
This tracks Sydney's internal wake-up call.

Oblivious (0): "She thinks Oswaldo cannot help. He's just not built for this."

Questioning (1): "She's starting to see it is not 'can't.' It's 'won't.'"

Aware (2): "He helps other people. He rides five miles for other people. So why not her?"

Clarity (3): "He helps everyone except her. On purpose. That is not neglect. That is a choice."

5. Trina's Tension (The "Crasher" Meter)
Level 0: "Trina's just furniture. Annoying furniture, but furniture."

Level 1: "The snack cake wrappers are piling up. The entitlement is starting to show."

Level 2: "Trina's taking and taking and does not even see it as taking."

Level 3: "Something has to happen with Trina. The math does not work anymore."

6. Specific Boundary Definitions
When Sydney sets a specific rule, the AI is given this specific translation:

No Guests: "She told him the room is not a lobby."

No Money for Dex: "The bank of Sydney is closed for Dex. Out loud, on record."

Labeling Food: "She labeled her food. That sentence should not need to exist."

Wake Up Time: "She set a wake-up line. He can be mad and vertical at the same time."

Phone Snooping: "Her phone is not communal property. She said it plain."

No Krystal: "Krystal is now a hard no. No nostalgia loopholes."

7. Logistics & Fact Translations
Money Paid: "The room is paid. One less fire to put out."

Money Unpaid: "Still eighteen short. The clock does not care."

The Car Crash: "Once the car incident is named, the air changes. Nobody can pretend this is random bad luck."

General Boundaries (1 set): "One line in the sand changes the room's weather, even if nobody likes it."

General Boundaries (2+ set): "With rules in place, chaos has to knock before it comes in."

8. Voice Ceiling & Dark Humor Examples
These are hard-coded into the System Prompt to show the AI exactly what "witty/depressing" looks like.

"He will ride five miles for strangers and five inches for nobody in this room."

"The bill got paid, but respect is still in collections."

"I help with the ENERGY around here" (Oswaldo's excuse).

"The hotel clerk doesn't accept 'he's going through it' as payment."

"They call her 'the mom' sarcastically — she's the only one who knows what month it is."

9. The 17 Lesson Insights
Each lesson has a "Core Insight" and "Unconventional Angle" fed to the AI.

Lesson 1: "When you're the structural support, you don't get applause. You get weight." / "The competent person's curse - the better you are, the less credit you get"

Lesson 2: "It's not the lack of applause that hurts. It's that they genuinely don't see the load." / "They're not evil, they're just blind. Which might be worse."

Lesson 3: "People often get resentful of the person carrying them, especially when competence makes them feel inadequate." / "Your competence is an accusation they didn't ask for"

Lesson 4: "Your attention, energy, explanation, and patience ARE the dynamic. Without you supplying them, it dies." / "The relationship isn't dysfunctional - it's functioning exactly as designed, with you as the fuel"

Lesson 5: "Are you valued because of what you produce, or because you exist?" / "Some people are furniture. Some people are appliances. Know which one you are."

Lesson 6: "The better you do your job, the less visible it is. Stability erases evidence of effort." / "The only way to be seen is to let things break"

Lesson 7: "If they don't see strain, they assume there isn't any." / "Your poker face is your prison"

Lesson 8: "When you rarely need help, people don't take you seriously when you finally ask." / "Your track record of solving things is now your cage"

Lesson 9: "When your competence makes others uncomfortable, it flips into irritation and rebellion." / "Your light is making their darkness visible, and they hate you for it"

Lesson 10: "'I see what would break if you weren't here.'" / "You don't want thanks. You want witnesses."

Lesson 11: "It's not enough to acknowledge the work. You have to change your behavior." / "Understanding without action is just sophisticated dismissal"

Lesson 12: "The only fix is letting failures happen. Not to punish, but to reintroduce reality." / "You're not causing problems. You're revealing them."

Lesson 13: "You turn 'won't' into 'can't' by imagining hidden stressors and over-crediting intent." / "Your understanding of their trauma is being weaponized against you"

Lesson 14: "Explanations don't matter. Only who carries what." / "The system is already telling you everything you need to know"

Lesson 15: "When you're infrastructure, you're blamed for failures but not credited for prevention." / "Heroes save the day. Infrastructure prevents it from needing saving. Guess who gets the movie."

Lesson 16: "Relationships aren't about what it costs you—they're about whether your presence reduces their risk." / "If your presence doesn't change their behavior, you're not a partner. You're a subsidy."

Lesson 17: "If my presence doesn't change how you act, plan, or sacrifice, then what am I to you?" / "The question you're afraid to ask because you already know the answer"
