# Stitch Prompt: `/play` (Clean Modern + Controlled Flair)

Use this prompt in Stitch:

```text
Design a clean modern gameplay screen for "No Vacancies" (`/play`) with restrained flair.

Core feel:
- Confident, composed, premium.
- Visual flair is allowed, but controlled: 15-20% expressive, 80-85% clear and practical.
- No clutter, no noisy gimmicks, no over-decorated gradients.

Layout requirements:
- Desktop: two-column layout.
  - Left: scene image with compact status overlay.
  - Right: story text panel + choices panel.
- Mobile: one-column stack with choices always visible after story text.
- Keep primary actions obvious within 3 seconds.

Must-have UX:
- Clear hierarchy for scene count, mode, and current narrative text.
- Choice buttons support visible ordering (1/2/3) and keyboard-hint affordances.
- Error/loading/empty states included.
- Keep lesson insight card readable but secondary.

Style direction:
- Modern editorial + subtle motel-noir edge.
- Strong typography contrast (expressive headings, highly readable body text).
- Controlled asymmetry and spacing rhythm.
- One subtle signature flourish (e.g., arc/progress accent bar or elegant overlay treatment).

Accessibility:
- Visible focus states.
- Readable contrast.
- Comfortable tap targets and spacing.
- Works cleanly on both desktop and mobile.

Avoid:
- Generic SaaS dashboard look.
- Hyperactive effects or "look at me" animations.
- Hidden primary actions.
- Tiny low-contrast text.

Deliverables:
1. Final screen design.
2. Component structure map.
3. Token suggestions (color, spacing, typography, radius, shadow).
4. Short implementation notes for SvelteKit integration.
