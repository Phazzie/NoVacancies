The clock on your phone glows 6:47 AM. Outside, the motel's neon sign buzzes faintly against the dawn gray. Inside, it's a tomb of bodies: Oswaldo sprawled across the bed like dead weight, mouth agape, one sock dangling off the edge. Trina's crashed on the floor amid a confetti of snack wrappers, Dex slumped in the corner chair, twitching in some dope dream. You're the only one awake. You've been up since 5, tallying the invisible ledger.

Envelope in your lap: $47. Room's $65, due by 11. Four hours, thirteen minutes. The manager won't care about Oswaldo's 'energy' or Trina's sob stories. You're the beam holding this up—wifi juggling, scam rotations, calorie-to-dollar ratios at the 7-Eleven. They lean harder every day, oblivious to the creak. No applause. Just weight.

Your five burners wait on the nightstand, pop sockets like tiny lifelines in the blue glow. The air smells of stale cigs and cold pizza crust. What do you do right now?


You swipe to the carding app on the main burner, thumbs slick now. High-risk drops: stolen CCs for gift card flips at corner stores, fast cash but feds spider those networks. The blue glow sharpens as you queue three: $20 Visa for iTunes at the 7-Eleven two blocks over, another for Amazon physical pickup. Dex's muttering fades to snores. Oswaldo's sock sways with his breath.

7:55 AM. First drop clears—$7 net after fees. Envelope: $66. Second: $4 more, $70 total. Over the line. But the third pings red—transaction flagged, IP shadow-ban. Heart kicks. You kill the session, rotate VPNs frantic. Close. Too close. The air clings with sweat and cold pizza ghosts, your veins electric from the tweak and adrenaline.

Burners stack quiet now, pop sockets warm. You've bridged the gap since 5 AM, math invisible as always. Clock mocks: 4 hours down, manager at 11. Dex stirs, eyes cracking. Interruptions. You've got the cash, but the creak in your spine whispers louder. No one sees the near-miss ledger.

You lean over Oswaldo, sock still half-dangling from the bedframe. Shake his shoulder—firm, but not frantic. "Door. Watch it. Envelope drop. Two minutes."

He cracks one eye, groans like it's a federal crime. "Yeah, yeah. Go." Props himself against the headboard, phone already in hand. Dex snores on. Trina's a lump under thin blankets. The blue glow from stacked burners fades as you pocket the envelope—$65 crisp, math invisible. Cold pizza scent clings as you slip out.

Lobby's empty, clerk slots it without looking. 8:10 AM. Back in four minutes flat. Door's ajar three inches. Oswaldo's slumped, snoring soft, phone scrolling forgotten in his lap. Trina's up, wrapper trail from fridge: your saved yogurt gone, spoon abandoned on the counter like modern art. She glances, shrugs. "Hungry."

Veins still hum from the tweak and grind. Rent's squared, but the slack hits like expected. He could've propped it, texted if needed. Five miles for Dex's smokes, but five feet for this? Nah. The creak in your spine sharpens. Interruptions own the morning now. What next?


You nudge Oswaldo harder this time, sock swaying like a flag of surrender. "Door was open. You were out cold. Envelope drop, remember?"

He blinks awake, rubbing his face, phone tumbling to the carpet. Trina crunches the empty yogurt cup, eyes flicking between you like bad TV. "What? I was right here. You were gone two seconds." Deflection classic—rewrite the tape before it plays. She patches it with one ugly move, buys one day of air, and everyone else mistakes that for stability. Rent's paid, math invisible, but this slack? Visible as the ajar door.

"Five miles for Dex's smokes yesterday," you say, voice flat, veins still humming from the tweak grind. "Five feet here? Nah."

He sits up sharper, tone flipping to accused. "Why do you always keep score? I was watching. Door didn't move. You're in a mood again." No 'my bad,' no rewind. Just the turn: your fault for expecting. Trina mutters, "Drama," wrapper confetti at her feet. Dex snores through it. Clock: 8:15 AM. Room bought till tomorrow, but the creak in your spine screams louder. Bridge scorched a little. Ground gained? Debatable. Air thick with stale yogurt and his unearned defense. What now?
